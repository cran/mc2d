=== mc2d ===

Version 0.1-8
=============

NEW FEATURES

- pmin.mcnode and pmax.mcnode 
- a second vignette

IMPROVEMENTS

- error message in mc when one argument was neither an mc nor an mcnode

BUG FIXES

- rempiricalC and qempiricalC lead to errors 

Version 0.1-7
=============

NEW FEATURES

- The documentation is now a real vignette
- mcratio, a function to measure variability and uncertainty
- extractvar and addvar, two utilities for multivariate nodes

IMPROVEMENTS

- Ops.mcnode function is much more efficient and less memory consuming
- great improvement for speed in mcstoc for multivariate distributions
- plot.mc proposes to fill the enveloppes
- empiricalD is (a little bit) more efficient

BUG FIXES

- lhs: could bug when sent without default distribution. Now, distr="runif" by default.
- lhs: nsv = ndvar() and nsu = ndunc() by default
- mcstoc: issue when rtrunc with linf or lsup as multivariate nodes: solved
- rtrunc: issue for discrete distribution. It is now clear that rtrunc sample within (linf, lsup]. As a consequence, linf should be strictly lower than lsup
- same issue in mcstoc

Version 0.1-6
=============


BUG FIXES

- Pert distribution: could bug when is.equal(mu,mode) while mu!=mode.
- mcprobtree: allows now to use mcvalues with a type different of
  the type of the ouptut


Version 0.1-5
=============


- Initial release on CRAN.
